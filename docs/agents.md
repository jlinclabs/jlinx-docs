# Agents

Agents are always-on actors that represent you online. 


### A JLINX Agent can

- hold and comply with digital contracts you sign
- maintain a personal database
- share and control access to your data with outside parties


Most users will have an agents from a hosted service provider called a [Federation](/docs/federations).

Alternatively Jlinx Agents are open source and you can run your own.
