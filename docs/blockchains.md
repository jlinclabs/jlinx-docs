# Blockchains


JLINX doesn't use one block chain. We've decentralized the block chain into personal author-only event streams called [Micro Ledgers](/docs/micro-ledgers). These "personal and topical block chains" are shared and merged to generate shared state through shared [projections](/docs/building-with-ledgers/projections)
