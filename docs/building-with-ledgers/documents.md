# Documents

Documents are backed by [Micro Ledgers](/docs/micro-ledgers) so their effectively an opt-log for edits to whatever type of document you want to create.

A JLINX Document link is the same as a Micro Ledger link. Example: 

`jlinx:u9qha-mQ2eMHZaxZOyEY-o0cXqCwTaR_zLZtfsUsfDAY`

to link to a specific version of a document you can append a `:{index}`. Example: 

`jlinx:u9qha-mQ2eMHZaxZOyEY-o0cXqCwTaR_zLZtfsUsfDAY:1337`


The value of a document is calculated using a [projection](/docs//building-with-ledgers/projections)
