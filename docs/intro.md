# JLINX

Welcome to the world of [Micro Ledgers](/)!

JLINX is prodounced "Jay" "Links" and is not an acronym. 

JLINX is an ecosystem of ledgers. Ledgers are created, shared, subscribed-to, and combined to build a real-time shared database for the distributed web.

The goal of JLINX is to lay a foundation of verifiable, auditable, gas-fee free, data exchange that can be shared with as many or as few other parties as needed.


## How JLINX Works

JLINX allows anyone to create and append to a virtually unlimited set of Micro Ledgers. Those Micro Ledgers can only be updated by you. You can share them as easily as you share a magnet link to a torrent you're seeding. You can also keep them private by not sharing or seeding them.

### Peer-to-Peer Communication

Any two parties can create and exchange Micro Ledgers to set up realtime bi-direction event streams.

### Publishing

By creating a Micro Ledger using a shared [Doc Type](/docs/doc-types) you can publish mutable (append-only) documents to the open web.
